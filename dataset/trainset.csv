Fun atmosphere but really checked out and disinterested wait staff. They try to take photos of you and sell a souvenir photo which is NOT my cup of tea (frozen OR hot). 
The frozen hot chocolate was great. I wish we would have stopped there but they require a $19 purchase per person. 
We had the cauliflower appetizer (too small but tasted fine) and the loaded fries (meh). 
Do not. I REPEAT DO NOT get a pina colada.

I ordered the BLT lobster roll with a lemonade. Hubby ordered the classic Maine lobster roll and a beer. My daughter ordered Mac and cheese. The rolls came with a lot of meat, juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were good and we enjoyed the slaw and pickle. My daughter enjoyed the Mac and cheese too. 
For dessert we had the banana bread pudding. It was a bit sweet but still  very Delish and had pieces of bananas in it. ThEy brought it with a candle and sang happy bday. Would def come back again! Only thing wish their prices were a bit more reasonable.",0,0,0,0,,

Every single time I come to Artichoke, the pizza is a great. I love pizza and find that I am pretty judge-y when it comes to NYC pizza and this place never disappoints. 
I typically get a pepperoni slice. I love that it has plenty of pepperoni for each bite and that the slice is really large and in charge. The crust is think, and cooked a little burnt which is my preference, and the rest of the dough is nice and thin. 
On my last visit I also ordered an artichoke slice, had to see what was in the name, and it didn't disappoint. It was messy, probably because of the different cheeses melting together and had a decent flavor. Although good, I think I'll stick with my usual pepperoni. 
The price is where you might consider not ordering but for the size of the slice, I think its worth it. Service is usually ok, fats paced, and ambiance is typical pizzeria.",1,0,0,0,,

I do not like ramen, but I tagged along with my husband and our friends because they all love ramen.

I'd never had one of these before but now I'm excited to come back to this restaurant, just so I can eat more of these!! I had two of them and some edamame while everyone else enjoyed their ramen. 
They have 3 vegetarian ramen options for those who want to enjoy ramen without having to worry about meat. Apparently they recently changed their menu as our friend's favorite ramen is no longer on the menu, but all of the ramen eaters at my table really enjoyed what they ordered!
The ambience is low lighting with beautiful decor throughout the restaurant. The service was excellent! We were quickly taken care of by the friendly staff.

I really do not understand the hype around this place; my friends and I were super excited to try one of the most highly ranked pizza places we saw online.

Already, my friend and I felt a bit sheepish but were thankful for the gesture. And then the owners appeared and told us that it was impossible for them to close the hours on their Yelp post without appearing to be permanently closed and that they were closed because of the damages done by hurricane Sandy.

The gift certificates were not necessary and Michelle and I felt like ignoramus idiots for only remembering then that Red Hook was submerged in water during the devastation.

It took a bit of time for the server to finally arrive at our table to take out order. We decided to order takoyaki and 2 classic tonkasu style Ramen.
The food arrived without too much of a wait. The dough on the takoyaki was heavier & doughier than what I'm used to and missing the bonito flakes. Instead it haa what appears to be tempura crunchies but were greasy & not necessary. I was excited for the ramen because of the broth. I can't say I was wowed as I remembered. The ramen was chewy texture and grabbed the broth well. The broth was rock, deep and sweet. But somehow the toppings seem more skkmpier and everything is added for extra.

Red Hook Lobster Pound surpassed all my expectations and the Down East Chowdah was one of the best soups I've had this year. 
-- On to the specifics
Came here after my fiance and I passed it on the way to the Brooklyn Crab. He really wanted a lobster roll and Brooklyn Crab did not scratch that itch for him so we ended up coming here the next day. I was put off at first at the prices ($25 for a roll) and wasn't actually going to get a lobster roll but once his arrived I had second guessed my decision. 
I ordered the fried lobster roll but the one I received was extremely salty, I was extremely disappointed and hadn't eaten all day so I ended up sending it back to the kitchen. I was apologized to profusely by multiple members of the staff and it was explained someone got a little heavy handed with the salt. I was asked if I wanted something else and ended up ordering the roll my guy had(Connecticut​ Roll). It was delicious, super meaty and tasty. They did not charge us for any lobster rolls. The fact that the staff was super diligent and apologetic made this experience THE BEST experience I've had at similar places in Brooklyn.
OH, THEY ALSO HAVE A LOBSTER SPECIAL ON WEDS!",2,0,0,0,"Feb 5, 2018","Thanks Raye. I am sorry that the fried lobster rol was salty and I do hope that you will come again.

815,Red Hook Lobster Pound,Kenny C.,"Brooklyn, NY",5,"May 5, 2015",no,1062,4499,19744,no,10 photos,,"Red Hook Lobster Pound is just swell. They were badly affected by Hurricane Sandy, but the owners used it as an opportunity to renovate their space and offer a more full dining experience. To that end, it looks like they've definitely succeeded.
We were able to just walk in on a Sunday night and grab a table. Our waitress apologized for the wait, even though it was literally 20 seconds.
Started out with some beers and a cup of the New England chowder, which was possibly the best I've had since I was in Boston years ago. Their beer selection is also pretty good. Lots of crafts.
We wanted to do the oysters Rockafella, but sadly, they were sold out for the day. Also sold out of the peel and eat shrimp. Sad face.
Oh well, that just meant we had to get more lobster! We split the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster chunks were oh so plentiful. With some fresh pepper from the grinder, it was perfect.
For my lobster roll, I went with Connecticut style. So buttery, with giant chunks of fresh, meaty lobster. About as good as it gets. The slaw on the side was decent, and I opted for potato salad, which was pretty good.
Of course, no review of the newly renovated Lobster Pound would be complete without reviewing the bathroom in the back. It's big and round, with a beach umbrella mounted to the ceiling, three beach cots on the ground, and mirrors all around (kind of like the funhouse sort). Definitely the coolest bathroom I've been to in recent memory (and I like bathrooms).

The line I guess to the left is to order pizza only. It didn't seem so long and I think most were just getting pies.
When I got up to the window I asked for 3 squares middles please. The guy looks down at the last 3 pieces he had in front of him which were 2 corners and a side which look like they have been there for a while. He shrugs his shoulders and said that all I got. I didn't want to hold up the line so I took the 3 pieces gave him the $12.
I have to say it was the worst pizza ive ever had. the crust was burnt and dry, the slices were cold. I had better pizza from a supermarket frozen boxed and thrown in the microwave.

Parking could be a lil tuff at times but we were lucky as we pulled up a car pulled out so that was easy ... 
Loved the inside dining room & bar area very comfortable not fancy nice a simple; the place was still quite only three tables or so ...
The server / bartender was very polite and gave us her recommendations; we opted for 2 - Connecticut Lobsters rolls @ $ 32 bucks each for a total of $ 64 bucks plus we took a Piña colada frozen drink also to go.. total $ 78.50 plus a $ 6 tip ya know lobster ya gotta pay !! 
Our order was ready to go in less then 10 minutes or so; we then ran down to our favorite BBQ Joint Home Town to get our BBQ Meat on, a lil Surf & Turf !! 
The lobster Roll; 1 roll had very nice size chunks & claw meat loaded real nice; Roll 2 was a bit of a disappointment no large chunks of lobster meat all tiny pieces. Also in my opinion not enough butter on both rolls also we would have like our roll / bun toasted a lil more ... 
Very fresh it was good at best; We frequently patronize Luke's lobster roll in Manhattan and in my opinion and my wife's Lukes blows them away......
Would I come back, no I don't think so; their lobsters rolls are supposed to be the star of their show  and they didn't deliver .... 
Do I recommend, only if Luke's goes out of business or if ya live in the area ...
