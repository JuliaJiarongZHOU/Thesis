0,"I LOVE Red Hook Lobster (RHL). I live in the DC area and first tried it here, but unfortunately the pandemic hit them hard and resulted in a closure. So, imagine my excitement when the hubby and I visited NY and saw RHL on the list for Smorgasburg. 
We visited RHL's food stall at Smorgasburg on 5/26/2024. I was laser focused on what I wanted upon arrival, yes, I saw there were other restaurants there, but did I care? No. I wanted RHL and basically nothing else!
I ordered the Connecticut roll - it was warm, buttery, with toasty bread and I almost fell down because my knees were weak. I freaking love this roll. After consuming it, I said, hmm, I want more and went back and got the Maine style lobster roll, which is the cold style. Both of these rolls were perfect, but my preference is certainly the Connecticut roll. 
My complaints, well the normal ones, I wish the rolls were double the size and half the price, but 2024 has lobster costing a million dollars a pound, so I get it.","- Category: Food Quality

I did this with my partner and it was so much food. We also got an order of 2 dozen oysters and let me tell you, those east coast oysters were the best I've ever tasted thus far.

15,"I have been faithfully coming here since around 2011, when it was a more modest setup with picnic style tables and you ordered at the counter. I love lobster, and I love the lobster here, and it's always been delicious, sweet, and fresh. It has been a tradition for years for my mother and I to celebrate our birthdays (only four days apart!) here. 
Then, they launched Lobster Week, and my trips out to Red Hook became even more frequent. 
The current layout of the restaurant is nice; nautical themed enough but not over the top. There's plenty of seating, but there are nights where it will be packed and you and your neighbors are at risk of flying lobster particles hitting one another. But the atmosphere is always lovely and lively. They have a great selection at the bar, and even though I usually default to a lobster dinner (how can you pass that up??), I will make it my mission to try everything on their menu. 
I definitely recommend the hot crab dip, their fries are awesome, the lobster bisque is divine, and of course, please be sure to get the lobster dinner and maybe add on a seafood boil while you're at it! 
Generally, pricing is as you'd expect for lobster in the city, but you really cannot beat their Lobster Week deals. I usually come several days (often consecutively) for Lobster Week, and this year, I managed seven visits in the month of September. 
The staff is so friendly and cool, and they are attentive and kind. I really love going here, and I'm always raving about the place to anyone who doesn't suffer a shellfish allergy (my condolences). I take al my friends, I've dined alone here on several occasions--no matter what, it is truly always a great time. 
Lobster is my favorite food and this is my favorite place to eat lobster, so it's basically my personal heaven.

30,"Do you like seafood? Me too. 
And to be clear, I'm not talking about the food I see when my four year old chews things up and shows it to me (I'm a little annoyed that joke is still a thing). I'm talking about all the wonderful things that get pulled out of the ocean, that we get to eat if we're lucky. 
And in Brooklyn, we are lucky, because Red Hook Lobster Pound has it all. Excellent lobster rolls, creamy clam chowder, perfectly fried shrimp and clam strips, fresh shrimp or lobster over a salad if that's your thing, and the beer to wash it all down. They also excel with their sides (brussels sprouts, fries, etc. are all delicious), and the takeout is lightning fast if you don't feel like hanging out there.
Best of all, right now it's Crab Week, and you can go in and get a nice pound of crab legs with potatoes and corn (although the potatoes and corn desperately need seasoning). You just have to decide how fancy you are, king, snow, or dungeness. 
Personally, I went with two friends and got one of each, because depending on the day, I can be fancy, kind of fancy, and a lowbrow piece of trash. 
We also added crab dip, and drank too much, because that's how you should do Crab Week.","- Category: Food Quality

Upon entry we had to greet him and say we want a table for two. Then he just pointed to our table and said menu is on the barcode and walked away that's literally the only words we got from him. Then when our food came out (1 Connecticut style lobster rolls w/ fries & 1 fried lobsterroll w/potato salad) I don't think they timed it correctly maybe they made the Connecticut Then waited for the fried one to be made as the French fries were cold and the lobster roll was cold. It was so bad we had to ask for the fries to be heated the lobster roll we just sucked up and ate cold it also looks likenthey are cutting back as ive never seen a roll from them look that skimpy.

Hostess was super nice and upbeat and even though we had reservations for 45 minutes later than when we arrived they were able to seat us at a booth located on the street. Like most places you scan the menu and it pops up on your phone and you're able to sort through several categories of items including soups, salads, shareable starters, lobster rolls and complete dinners. Being your known for lobster rolls that's what we opted for. We ordered one classic and one Connecticut. Both came with at least one full claw and nice chunks of lobster. Yes most people would agree the portion size could be bigger for the price that you're paying which was $32 for a lobster roll and a side of fries or coleslaw or potato salad. Now I know that transportation and cost a rising all across the board but when two people share one appetizer, have three lobster rolls(one to go) and two drinks the total was like $120. Think it's a bit steep. But it was a nice night, servers were friendly and we came, we ate and we can say , hey I was at Red Hook Lobster Pound.","- Category: Food Quality
