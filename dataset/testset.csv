Next time either tell us about the charge to crack the lobster open or don't tell us and just charge because no one should have to fight with food, that should be common sense and who wants to eat it after it's been on the floor.

Im so sorry to hear about this experience, Cracking lobster does cost $3 and that should have been explained to you once you asked about it.

Stopped here before my concert for dinner and it definitely hit the spot. I wasn't a fan of the gyoza it lacked flavor in my opinion but the ramen was delicious.
My two downsides were the shared seating, this can definitely get awkward and I'd say 75% of the spot is shared. As well as the bamboo shoots tasted liked they came from a can :/ very metallic taste to them and not at all how I've had in the past.
However the ambiance is welcoming and relaxed. Our server was attentive and quick and food came out fast!
Definitely make a reservation. Even during the week. Menu has some food options but I wouldn't see myself coming back here. There's a lot of great ramen spots in NYC and this is just alright.",5,1,4,0,,

This place is a bit on the pricy but it's still doable. The try both the new England and downeast and I recommend the downeast since its more flavorful. the new England is a bit too watery for my taste. Also, avoid the fried lobster roll but rather either the classic or the BLT since you taste more the Lobster flavor in my opinion since the fried lobster takes away that flavor.

Small and more of a takeout space with stand and eat areas as well outdoor seating.
I saw about 8 different Slice options.  The slices are huge and can easily feed two.  Ordered the Artichoke and Pepperoni/Meatball slices.  
Artichoke was very good although not what I expected.  It's a rich and decadent slice given the cream sauce and two cheeses.  Thought the sauce had a seafood taste to it but ingredients don't indicate any seafood.  More Artichokes please.  Overall, unique slice and one is more than a meal.
Pepperoni/Meatball was excellent.  Great balance of toppings and sauce and really liked the Meatball topping.

I visited this establishment since I was at a nearby IKEA and seen this restaurant had a lot of good reviews. Parking in this area can be a task, however, I was lucky enough to find parking right out front. Upon entering I noticed they have a large number of seatings as well as a few outside if you wanted to get some sun while you grub. They also have specials from 3pm-6pm Monday-Friday $1 oysters as well as $6 draft beers which are quite the bargain. I was seated very quickly and ordered the Connecticut lobster roll since I wanted something warm. I usually would get a main classic lobster roll which is cold when I go to other lobster roll establishments but decided to try something different. It came with French fries and coleslaw. It was a little pricey at $26 however compared to other lobster roll joints they really pack that roll for that price which is a huge thumbs up. The french fries were very salty and I was not a fan of that coleslaw.

On Friday, March 24 I was craving pizza and not any pizza but Artichoke Pizza. I bought 3 slices and paid the employee by credit card and I also left a $2 cash tip. The pizza was amazing as always. Fast forward a few days later when I received the credit card charge for $2 more than the bill. You might be thinking it's only $2 but that's $2 that was stolen after I already left a $2 cash tip that I didn't have to leave as it's an order and go establishment not a sit down dining experience. On Monday, March 27 I spoke with the manager who at first wanted me to believe it was an honest mistake but realized that I wasn't letting this go and so he agreed to refund me the $2. I went after work from Midtown to the 14th street location only to find that the manager had already left for the day. I spoke with another employee who was aware of the situation and explained that the manager had credited me the full amount. I called my credit card company before leaving Artichoke and was told it could take a week or more before I would receive the credit. It is now April 6 and no credit has been received. So not only was I the victim of being stolen from but also lied to and inconvenienced by the store manager.

First: a Hole in the wall place with no seating (or restroom)
Second: the ""artichoke"" pizza topping was essentially tasteless white glop with a few pieces of spinach and even fewer pieces of artichoke mixed in. The glob reminded me of the cheap crema used in Mexican fast food (at least places nowhere near Mexico). Just awful!  Having lived in the SF Bay Area for 30 years, my wife and I know artichokes and artichoke pizza. Never again here.
Third: place was not busy. One one customer besides us at 4:30 pm on a weekday, yet counter guy was inattentive.
Fourth: very pricey! $22 for two slices and two cans of coke.
On the good side: the slices were about 50% larger than average NYC neighborhoods slices. And my wife got a pepperoni/sausage slice which was not bad. For that pie they used the standard Stanislaus 7-11 tomato sauce. Yes we are pizza connoisseurs and know the ingredient sources for many of the NY joints.

522,The Halal Guys,Matthew L.,"North Haven, CT",5,"Mar 4, 2024",no,342,653,8239,no,9 photos,,"The Halal Guys is a Halal street food cart and restaurant chain that launched in Manhattan, New York in 1990. It was founded by Egyptian immigrants Mohamed Abouelenein, Ahmed Elsaka and Abdelbaset Elsayed. The three partners traveled to the United States in the 1980s with hopes for a better life and dreams of entrepreneurial success. They first started off with a hot dog food cart. By 1992 they had switched to an option that no one else was tackling: authentic Halal food! They initially catered to Muslim taxi drivers who had few options for Halal cuisine. It wasn't long before a much more diverse clientele was going crazy for the Halal Guys' delicious platters of chicken and gyro over rice, falafel, pita and famous white sauce. Although Halal food vendors can now be found all over New York City, it was the Halal Guys who originated the craze. More food carts would pop up around the city before the partners turned their attention to franchising brick & mortar locations. As of 2024, there are well over 100 Halal Guys locations spread out over five countries... but the food carts can still be found at the intersection of W 53rd Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan. 
My family and I have been enjoying the Halal Guys' delicious food for many years now. We were very excited when a brick & mortar location opened in my home of New Haven in 2016. I visited many times until it closed in 2021 due to water damage from a burst pipe. I anxiously await the day that a new location opens in Connecticut. My family and I recently visited the original location in NYC. After a long day exploring in the city, we wanted to grab some dinner to take with us on the train back to Connecticut. When we saw the food carts, our minds were immediately made up. We decided to order and share two of their famous platters: one with falafel and one with chicken. As always, they tasted amazing; really hit the spot! We'll continue to be happy Halal Guys customers for years to come!",1,0,2,0,"Mar 4, 2024"," Thank you for the positive comments about The Halal Guys! We are lucky to have customers like you!

Great service, slightly a bit slow but everyone was accommodating. Just a fair warning if you have a reservation, you still might have to wait at least 20 mins for your table. 
What we ordered: 
Edamame Dumplings: 3/5 
So these are delicious, however I feel like they're lacking more flavor. The texture is chewy and delicious, tastes more like mashed potatoes dumplings. 
Chili Rock Shrimp: 4/5 
Decent amount, has a slight lack in flavor. Was expecting there to be a slight kick in the sauce, however there is nothing spicy about it. Paired this up with a side sauce that I ordered in addition where they mixed what seemed like chili paste and some Thai sweet chili. Would highly recommend asking for those sauces if you order this dish! 
Mongolian Lamb: 5/5 
Lamb was cooked perfectly!! The sauce added was also delicious. Tasted like a sweet garlic. The bokchoy was also good, just interesting they chopped off the leafy part that most people consume. 
Tuna tar tar spring rolls: 4/5 
Delicious, fish tasted fresh, and paired so nicely with the   crunchy spring roll. 
Crying Chocolate: 5/5 
I'm not a huge dessert fan, but this was exquisite! I loved that the lava cake was paired with Vietnamese coffee, and the coffee crumble worked so well with one another. Would order again! So many unique textures and flavors combined with each other.

Easily one of the best, if not the best slice I have ever had. Amazing crisp crust that stands straight out at attention without being too tough. Incredible snap when you bite into it. Great crust around the edge. You can hear how awesome it is from across the table. The sauce and cheese are delicious and in the proper proportion. Very fun old-school vibe. Just a great outing. Cannot wait to go back. I don't care how long the subway ride is.",0,0,1,0,,

I almost wish they could just make a side artichoke dip, the sauce is that good.
Highly recommend the pepperoni vodka slice as well.
I haven't been here in-person yet, but it's nice having such a delicious late-night delivery option when pizza is needed!",1,0,0,0,,

While my wife waited in the line Adel's, I waited in the one here for Halal Guy's food. I the ended up getting this one first and eating it in the line for Adel's haha! But it was delicious.  Absolutely no complaints about the flavor or the service.  The difference is just that Adel's uses magic chicken which is hard to come by these days.",1,0,2,0,"Aug 28, 2023"," Hi Edward, thanks for the 5-star review!

The chicken was flavorful and the beef was pretty good. Service was great.
